The automatic generation of facial images has been well researched since the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) came out. 
There are some attempts to apply the GAN model to the problem of generating facial images of anime characters, but none of the existing works provide a promising result. In this work, we investigated the training of GAN models specialized on a dataset of anime facial images. 
We solved the problem from both the data and the model perspective, by collecting cleaner, more appropriate datasets and using the right empirical DRAGAN application
Through quantitative analysis and case studies, we demonstrated that our efforts lead to a stable and high-quality model. 
The automatic generation of anime characters offers an opportunity to bring a custom character into existence without professional skill. 
Besides the beneÔ¨Åts for a non-specialist, professional creator may take advantages of the automatic generation for inspiration on animation and game character design
